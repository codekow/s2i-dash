# Example Dash OpenShift / s2i Repo

This is meant to be a good starting point for creating Dash applications that are deployed to OpenShift.

## How to use this repo to build your own application

1. Fork this repository into your own Git repo
    - This will create a copy that you will own
2. Log into OpenShift
2. Select the project in which you want to add an application
    - There will be a dropdown of projects you have permissions to
3. Go to the catalog and select 'python' to create a new python application
4. Enter the app name and the URL for the app's repository (from step #1),
5. Click 'Create'

## Local development

Setup virtual environment

```sh
python -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate

pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run w/ python `_main_`

```sh
python wsgi.py
```

OR

Run w/ `gunicorn` (s2i python container does this)

```sh
gunicorn wsgi:application -c config.py
```

Access via <http://localhost:8080/>

## WSGI / gunicorn

This sample Python application relies on the support provided by the default S2I builder for deploying a WSGI application using the ``gunicorn`` WSGI server. The requirements which need to be satisfied for this to work are:

- The WSGI application code file needs to be named ``wsgi.py``.
- The WSGI application entry point within the code file needs to be named ``application``.
- The ``gunicorn`` package must be listed in the ``requirements.txt`` file for ``pip``.

In addition, the ``.s2i/environment`` file has been created to allow environment variables to be set to override the behavior of the default S2I builder for Python.

- The environment variable ``APP_CONFIG`` has been set to declare the name of the config file for ``gunicorn``.

## More information about this project

This repo contains an example dash application that can be deployed to OpenShift using Source to Image (S2I). Here are the main files:

1. The Dash Application (learn about Dash [HERE](https://dash.plotly.com/) )

    - `wsgi.py`;  main application, to be run by gunicorn

    - `app/model.py`;  an optional file, to demonstrate how to modularize code

    - `app/layout.py`;  an optional file, to demonstrate how to modularize code

2. The S2I environment variables. Used to setup additional environment varibles (ex: setup packages using a Nexus repository)

    - `.s2i/environment`

3. This file should contain the dependencies that your application needs to run, and those dependencies should be 'pinned' to a version.

    - `requirements.txt`

    One way to create a requirements file for your application is by running the following:

    ```
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

#### How it works

The file `wsgi.py` contains the instructions for python to run Dash.

It relies on `app/model.py` to run calculations on some data, and on `app/layout.py` to return a plotly figure that can be shown by the application.

When s2i builds the container, it will look into `.s2i` for additional instructions, including environment variables for installing packages with `pip`.
